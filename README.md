Fundamental Algorithms lab. assignments | 2nd year @ uni.

Various implementations of basic sorting algorithms such as HeapSort or QuickSort and others for graph traversing (BFS & DFS). The purpose of the lab works was to compare different sets of algorithms and understand how they differ in terms of computed operations (assignments and comparisons).

The profiler was provided by the uni staff - it helps plot the graphs (.html format) for the algorithm comparison and analysis.
